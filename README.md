### Marcel van Brakel (1970) 
is currently artistic director of cross media group Polymorf. He works as independent media designer, play writer, librettist and film and  theatre director. Marcel was co- founder of film collective FlimFilm and worked as a theatre director at Het Witte Vuur.
Van Brakel is also a lecturer Multimedia Design, 3D Design and Performativity the Department of Communication Media Design at the Avans University of Applied Science in Breda.
Polymorf designs immersive experiences and media projects. The projects are time based and often engage all senses. Projects are ranging from interactive art-installations, advertising, educational projects, film, theatre and operas. Polymorf, projects reflect on the now, the (post) human condition and relationships between humans and technology.

### Michael Straeubig 
(www.i3games.de) is a PhD candidate, game designer and creative coder, exploring games and playful experiences in various media with a focus on mixed reality / locative play.

### Daniela de Paulis 
is artist in residence at the Dwingeloo radio telescope and ASTRON (www.astron.nl). She is currently guest researcher  at ASCA (Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis), University of Amsterdam, developing her research on Interstellar Transmissions. Since 2010 she has been collaborating with the international collective Astronomers Without Borders (AWB), as the founder and director of the AstroArts programme. In 2013 she founded Cabine Voltaire, a pioneering online, collaborative platform for live debates on science, technology and the humanities. She is a member of the Permanent International SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Committee. www.opticks.info and www.danieladepaulis.com

### Martina Huynh
I'm a Swiss student currently studying at the Design Academy in Eindhoven.
The design projects I work on often focus on exploring questions around cultural and societal trends and how to engage with them from a new perspective through design research, esp. the kind involving performative methods.

### Marloeke van der Vlugt (1971) 
is a Dutch artist and researcher. After graduating from Theatre Studies at the University of Amsterdam, she studied Scenography at Goldsmithâ€™s Academy London and  Choreography at the Laban Centre in London. As a scenographer and video maker she worked with a number of (inter)national directors and theatre groups. At DasArts, (Amsterdam School of the Arts), she specialised herself, assembling theoretical and hands-on knowledge on the relationship between technology and performance.

Marloeke is currently affiliated as a tutor with the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht and as a researcher with HKU Research Centre Performative Processes. 

## WHY?

We are interested in exploring the possibility of other cognitive sites in the body, other than the brain. 

## WHAT?

We decided to focus on the gut-brain connection because the gut greatly influence our psychological, emotional and cognitive well-being and viceversa. 
We created an installation called 'Brainy-Gutty' which explores the gut-brain connection through EEG through experiment and play.

## HOW

We built an installation where one computer running Open BCI is used for detecting the signals produced simultaneously by the brain and the gut. The signals are transmitted in real time to another computer where Arduino is used to modulate the power of two pumps connected to the brain and gut signals respectively. The pumps inflate a bunch of plastic bags alternatively, according to the strength of the brain and gut signals. The plastic bags sustain two transparent plastic spheres containing liquids: one sphere is half filled with artificial blood, the other sphere is half filled with our saliva. The two spheres are lifted and lowered in synchrony with the gut-brain signals, exchanging their liquids through transparent plastic tubes.
